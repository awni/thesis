\section{Analysis}

The model outperforms the average cardiologist score on both the sequence and
the set F1 metrics. Figure~\ref{fig:arrhythmia:model_confusion} shows a
confusion matrix of the model predictions on the test set. Many arrhythmias are
confused with the sinus rhythm. We expect that part of this is due to the
sometimes ambiguous location of the exact onset and offset of the arrhythmia in
the ECG record.

Often the mistakes made by the model are understandable. For example, confusing
Wenckebach and AVB\_Type2 makes sense given that the two rhythms in general
have very similar ECG morphologies. Similarly, Supraventricular Tachycardia
(SVT) and Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB) are often confused with Atrial Flutter
(AFL) which is understandable given that they are all atrial arrhythmias. We
also note that Idioventricular Rhythm (IVR) is sometimes mistaken as
Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), which again makes sense given that the two only
differ in heart-rate and are difficult to distinguish close to the 100 beats
per minute delineation.

One of the most common confusions is between Ectopic Atrial Rhythm (EAR) and
the sinus rhythm. The main distinguishing criteria for this rhythm is an
irregular P wave. This can be subtle to detect especially when the P wave has a
small amplitude or when noise is present in the signal.
